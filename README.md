# Beach volley tournament

## Description

This is an app (in React) for beach volley players who want to join sport events created by other beach volley players. The goal is to help users to organize better their sports championship. 

The user will be able to register to see all sports events information and be able to register in the different matchs.

Now, in the MVP, the users register as a team. In future developments, I will add a USER Model (now is Team Model) and the users will be able to create teams and join the matchs with their teams.

## User Stories
